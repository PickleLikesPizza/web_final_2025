    <p>mangoes are the perfect summer and spring fruit, and when they're chilled it just tastes like heaven! :D even the sour ones taste good, so this must be an <span style="color:rgb(179, 67, 67)">s tier</span> fruit!</p>
    <div class="bulletpoint">
        <ul>
            <li><h3>a tier - watermelons</h3></li>
        </ul>

    <p>watermelon is very sweet, and most of the time it tastes delicious, but the large amount of seeds and bitter white rind part brings it down to <span style="color:rgb(196, 157, 58)">a tier</span>. it's still a great fruit regardless. C:</p>
    <div class="bulletpoint">
        <ul>
            <li><h3>b tier - apples</h3></li>
        </ul>

    <p>apples are very yummy and can be enjoyed all year! however, they can be sour, and the green and yellow apples are not as tasty as the red ones, so it's brought down to <span style="color:rgb(67, 179, 73)">b tier</span>.</p>
    <div class="bulletpoint">
        <ul>
            <li><h3>c tier - peaches</h3></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <img class="rounded" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/42/11/90/421190a04a80e034d73336a804a8e8d9.jpg">
    <p>peaches are yummy and its fuzziness helps its case, but its pit does bring it down a bit. it's still sweet but that cannot redeem it that much, making it a solid <span style="color:rgb(67, 145, 179)">c tier</span> fruit.</p>
    <div class="bulletpoint">
        <ul>
            <li><h3>d tier - lemons</h3></li>
        </ul>

    <p>lemons are very sour, and unless you put a slice of it on drink or as a food topper, nobody would willingly eat a full lemon unless it was a dare. it's too sour to be a good standalone fruit. <span style="color:rgb(82, 67, 179)">d tier</span>.</p>
     <div class="bulletpoint">
        <ul>
            <li><h3>f tier - limes</h3></li>
        </ul>

    <p>limes are just the wannabe quirky lemons. you rarely see them in anything except for candy flavors, and they're equally sour to lemons and are just a bad fruit in general. this goes in <span style="color:rgb(170, 67, 179)">f tier</span>. :C</p>
