    <h3>THEATER</h3>
    <img class="image" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/cc/83/6f/cc836f3cc7682856e8e7f975db9db299.jpg">
    <p>take this with a grain of salt because im a theater kid 💀 BUT. there's just a certain sense and AURA around performing. like, the people came there to see YOU! and also you sing and its AMAAAAAZING!</p>
    <h3>AIRPLANES</h3>
    <img class="image" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c0/61/88/c06188a342348d420f4ee8976fe951ae.jpg">
    <p>airplanes are so cool since they're literally giant tin cans that go several miles in the air 😱😱😱. but also people dont realize how COOL airplanes look... like you can't say an A350 looks bad. they're SO COOL. i would like to fly on more planes and airlines, but i do NOT have the budget for that, so instead i just took at them online or go planespotting (essentially taking pictures of planes at airports) in my freetime.</p>
    <h3>DRAWING</h3>
    <img class="image" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/5b/80/c7/5b80c71f7f60e7e1123d45b4ae5cfac5.jpg">
    <p>i have always drawn since i was like 4 or something and i've done a lot of mediums actually 🤓 such as, *hem hem* chalk pastels, watercolors, acrylics, pencil, ink,and digital of course. whenever i doodle however, which makes up most of my art time 😭, i use pencil or pen.</p>
    <h3>ARCHITECTURE</h3>
    <img class="image" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/38/26/33/382633d58c9af2f18ea69895f25aad36.jpg">
    <p>one of the few majors i'm actually considering for college, i've always been interested in buildings. in fact, i had a ring in elementary school where i dished out drawings of buildings i made 💀 although the DRAWINGS were modern architecture (aka the boxy ones), i'm specifically interested in gothic and romanesque architecture.</p>
